### Include non-visual information

      This can mean including the name of the {props.associated} with the {props.visual} so anyone
      who doesn't see the {props.visual} still gets the name. But if the {props.visual} is present
      next to text with the name, don't include the name with the {props.visual} so it's not
      repeated.

    <p>
      By default, the {props.visual} comes with alternative text that's the same as the name of the{" "}
      {props.associated}. Check to make sure that this information is meaningful and not
      unnecessarily repeated.
