## Content

### Write positive labels

In addition to [writing positively in general](/kiwi-use/content/voice-and-tone/passionate/#use-positive-language),
you should especially focus on positive labels for checkboxes.
Focus on what happens when the checkbox is selected.
Don't use the selected state for turning off features.

### Use parallel labels

Whether you're offering filters for transport options,
types of notifications to receive, or additional services to purchase,
always present options using the same structure.
