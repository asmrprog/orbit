## Overview

Buttons communicate actions that users can take.
They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like: Dialogs, Forms, Toolbars, etc.

## Component structure

<ComponentStructure
  component="Button"
  web={{
    Image: WebStructureImage,
    imageWidth: 124,
    parts: [
      {
        name: "IconLeft",
        description: "Optionally visually supports button visibility.",
      },
      {
        name: "Label",
        description: "Describes main action. Works best when short.",
      },
      {
        name: "IconRight",
        description: "Optionally shows the action for the button (expandable, link, etc.).",
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

## Guidelines

### Identify the most important actions

> If everything looks important, then nothing is important.
>
> ---Patrick Lencioni

Users need to be certain of what action to take next.
You need to know which actions are the most important within a given section of the user flow.

Once you've identified which actions are the most important at the moment,
you can indicate importance through [size, type, and variation](#mobile-vs-desktop-size).

<Guideline
  type="do"
  title="Have one primary action"
  svgs={[ButtonPrimaryActionDo, ButtonPrimaryActionDont]}
/>

<Guideline type="do" title="Show importance hierarchy" svgs={[ButtonShowHierarchy]} />

### Avoid disabled buttons

Many designers want to show users that actions will be possible in the future,
so they end up using disabled buttons to show potential actions.
But such buttons often end up confusing users about what's possible.

Instead, try to focus on using [progressive disclosure](/design-patterns/progressive-disclosure/)
to show them only the actions they should take right at the moment.
Then when it's possible for them to take action, you can show them more buttons.

If you need to use a disabled button,
always make it clear how users can activate it,
such as with a [tooltip](/components/overlay/tooltip/).

### Button types

Buttons come in **three sizes** (large, normal, and small)
and **three types** (primary, secondary, and critical).
Two of these types (primary and critical) also have **subtle** versions in lighter shades
to show actions that don't draw as much attention.

Primary buttons are best for the [single primary action](#identify-the-most-important-actions) on the screen.
Critical buttons work for destructive actions---actions users can't take back.
All remaining actions can be secondary buttons or [another component](#usage-of-the-component).

<Guideline type="do" title="Don't use primary buttons to manipulate users" />

### Buttons with icons

Buttons with icons are great when you need to draw more attention to the action.
Icons add additional context and makes the buttons more easy to scan.

But it's essential to not overuse these buttons.
If everything is grabbing attention, things usually get messy.

<Guideline type="do" title="Right icons should only be directional" />

<Guideline type="do" title="Add a label when using icon-only buttons" />
